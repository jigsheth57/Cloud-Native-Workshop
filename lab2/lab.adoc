= Lab 2 - Responsive Web UI for Contact Data Service Application

== Background

This application is a front-end mobile-first Web Application for the Contact Data Service using Spring Boot, AngularJS & AMQP. This web application allows you to create, retrieve, update, & delete Contact using Contact Data Service. The web application also provides user interface to monitor the publish change event by Contact Data Service.


== Push It!

. Change to the _contactWebApp_ sample application directory:
+
----
$ cd $WORKSHOP_HOME/lab2/contactWebApp
----
. Create Service Instances for contactWebApp
.. Note: We are **creating a user provided service instance**. This service instance will allow contactWebApp to locate and communicate with contactDataService. We are also **creating Redis service instance** to externalize the HTTP Session, so you can scale and loadbalance webapp without loosing session data.
.. Note: replace the uri value below with your contactDataService uri. You can obtain the contactDataService uri by executing command: **cf apps**
+
[source,bash]

$ cf apps

<1> The CLI is using a manifest to provide necessary configuration details such as application name, memory to be allocated, and path to the application artifact.
Take a look at `manifest.yml` to see how.
<2> In most cases, the CLI indicates each Cloud Foundry API call as it happens.
In this case, the CLI has created an application record for _Workshop_ in your assigned space.
<3> All HTTP/HTTPS requests to applications will flow through Cloud Foundry's front-end router called http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/router.html[(Go)Router].
Here the CLI is creating a route with random word tokens inserted (again, see `manifest.yml` for a hint!) to prevent route collisions across the default `local.pcfdev.io` domain.
<4> Now the CLI is _binding_ the created route to the application.
Routes can actually be bound to multiple applications to support techniques such as http://www.mattstine.com/2013/07/10/blue-green-deployments-on-cloudfoundry[blue-green deployments].
<5> The CLI finally uploads the application bits to Pivotal Cloudfoundry. Notice that it's uploading _125 files_! This is because Cloud Foundry actually explodes a ZIP artifact before uploading it for caching purposes and uploads only files that has change from previous push.
<6> Now the CLI is _binding_ the service instances, we created in previous step, to the application. (again, see `manifest.yml` for a hint!)
<7> Now we begin the staging process. The https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack[Java Buildpack] is responsible for assembling the runtime components necessary to run the application.
<8> Here we see the version of the JRE that has been chosen and installed.
<9> The complete package of your application and all of its necessary runtime components is called a _droplet_.
Here the droplet is being uploaded to Pivotal Cloudfoundry's internal blobstore so that it can be easily copied to one or more _http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/execution-agent.html[Droplet Execution Agents (DEA's)]_ for execution.
<10> The CLI tells you exactly what command and argument set was used to start your application.
<11> Finally the CLI reports the current status of your application's health.
====

==== Test the application using browser

. Visit the application in your browser by hitting the route that was generated by the CLI:
+
====

. point the browser to your application url. For example: http://contactwebapp-kempy-gemination.local.pcfdev.io
+
image::lab2.png[]

. Click on Even Notification button and See the events being generated when interacting with contactDataService. contactDataService will publish any events that modifies the Domain Model to RabbitMQ.
+

====

== Interact with App from CF CLI

. Get information about the currently deployed application using CLI apps command:
+
----
$ cf apps
----
+
Note the application name for next steps

. Get information about running instances, memory, CPU, and other statistics using CLI instances command
+
----
$ cf app contactWebApp
----
. Scale the application using CLI instances command and use the browser in "Incognito" mode to access the applicaion. Observe the behavior and notice **User's sessionid** and **Application Instance #**. As you refresh the browser, you will be loadbalancing across multiple instance of the app, but sessionid will remain same.
+
----
$ cf scale contactWebApp -i 2
----
. kill the container and see how PCF auto-heals it self
+
----
$ cd $WORKSHOP_HOME
$ ./kill_app_instance contactwebapp 0

Note: for windows user, you can execute following commands:
$ cf app contactWebApp --guid
Note: copy the guid value from above response and relace it with ${GUID} below:
$ cf curl /v2/apps/${GUID}/instances/${INSTANCE#} -X 'DELETE'

Now you can monitor the app for auto healing
$ cf app contactWebApp
----
. Stop the deployed application using the CLI
+
----
$ cf sp contactWebApp
$ cf sp contactDataService
----
. Delete the deployed application using the CLI
+
----
$ cf d -r contactWebApp
$ cf d -r contactDataService
----
. Delete the service instances created previously using the CLI
+
----
$ cf ds p-mysql -f
$ cf ds p-rabbitmq -f
$ cf ds contact-service -f
$ cf ds p-redis -f
