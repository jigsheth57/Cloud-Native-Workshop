= Lab 1 - From Zero to Pushing Your First Application

== Background

This application is a backend RESTFul event-driven data service using Spring Boot, JPA, REST & AMQP. Using link:++http://projects.spring.io/spring-data-jpa/++[Spring Data JPA], it implementation of data access layers by reducing the effort to the amount that's actually needed. As a developer you write your repository interfaces, including custom finder methods, and Spring will provide the implementation automatically. By providing dependency to Spring Data REST, it will make the JPA repository RESTFul. In addtion, we have also implemented EntityListener, which would emmit any changes to the Entity/Domian Model and publish the change event onto messaging bus (RabbitMQ) using AMQP.

To learn more about the Spring Boot Web App using Spring Data JPA, take a look at the link:++https://springframework.guru/spring-boot-web-application-part-3-spring-data-jpa++[tutorial].

== Target

. If you haven't already, download the latest release of the link:++https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases++[Cloud Foundry CLI] for your operating system and install it.

. Optionally, you should install link:++https://github.com/spring-projects/rest-shell#readme++[Spring REST Shell] to test out the application. You can also use any other REST client that supports full set of HTTP Methods (PUT, POST, DELETE & GET) such as link:++https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/advanced-rest-client/hgmloofddffdnphfgcellkdfbfbjeloo++[Advance REST Client]

. Set the API target for the CLI: (set appropriate end point for your environment)
+
----
$ cf api https://api.pcf5.cloud.fe.pivotal.io --skip-ssl-validation
----

. Login to Pivotal Cloudfoundry:
+
----
$ cf login
----
+
Follow the prompts

== Push It!

. Change to the _contactDataService_ sample application directory:
+
----
$ cd $WORKSHOP_HOME/lab1/contactDataService
----
. Create Service Instances for contactDataService (set appropriate service and service plan for your environment)

----
<1> The CLI is using a manifest to provide necessary configuration details such as application name, memory to be allocated, and path to the application artifact.
Take a look at `manifest.yml` to see how.
<2> In most cases, the CLI indicates each Cloud Foundry API call as it happens.
In this case, the CLI has created an application record for _Workshop_ in your assigned space.
<3> All HTTP/HTTPS requests to applications will flow through Cloud Foundry's front-end router called http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/router.html[(Go)Router].
Here the CLI is creating a route with random word tokens inserted (again, see `manifest.yml` for a hint!) to prevent route collisions across the default `devcloudwest.inbcu.com` domain.
<4> Now the CLI is _binding_ the created route to the application.
Routes can actually be bound to multiple applications to support techniques such as http://www.mattstine.com/2013/07/10/blue-green-deployments-on-cloudfoundry[blue-green deployments].
<5> The CLI finally uploads the application bits to Pivotal Cloudfoundry. Notice that it's uploading _114 files_! This is because Cloud Foundry actually explodes a ZIP artifact before uploading it for caching purposes and uploads only files that has change from previous push.
<6> Now the CLI is _binding_ the service instances, we created in previous step, to the application. (again, see `manifest.yml` for a hint!)
<7> Now we begin the staging process. The https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack[Java Buildpack] is responsible for assembling the runtime components necessary to run the application.
<8> Here we see the version of the JRE that has been chosen and installed.
<9> Here we see the JDBC driver is pulled in automatically, since the mysql service instance is bound to application.
<10> The complete package of your application and all of its necessary runtime components is called a _droplet_.
Here the droplet is being uploaded to Pivotal Cloudfoundry's internal blobstore so that it can be easily copied to one or more _http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/execution-agent.html[Droplet Execution Agents (DEA's)]_ for execution.
<11> The CLI tells you exactly what command and argument set was used to start your application.
<12> Finally the CLI reports the current status of your application's health.

== Test the backed data service app using Spring REST Shell

. Visit the application in your browser by hitting the route that was generated by the CLI. For example: point the browser to following url: http://contactdataservice-untippled-birthplace.cfapps.io/contacts

====
[source,bash]
----
Start up the Spring REST Shell application

$ rest-shell

== Interact with App from CF CLI

. Get information about the currently deployed application using CLI apps command:
+
----
$ cf apps
----
+
Note the application name for next steps

. Get information about running instances, memory, CPU, and other statistics using CLI instances command
+
----
$ cf app <<app_name>>
----
. Scale the application using CLI instances command
+
----
$ cf scale <<app_name>> -i 2
----
. kill the container and see how PCF auto-heals it self
+
----
$ cd $WORKSHOP_HOME
$ ./kill_app_instance <<app_name>> 1

Note: for windows user, you can execute following commands:
$ cf curl /v2/apps?q=name:contactDataService
Note copy the guid value from result: resources->metadata->guid
$ cf curl /v2/apps/${GUID}/instances/${INSTANCE#} -X 'DELETE'

Now you can monitor the app for auto healing
$ cf app contactDataService

----
. Stop the deployed application using the CLI
+
----
$ cf stop <<app_name>>
----
. Delete the deployed application using the CLI
+
----
$ cf delete <<app_name>> -r
----
