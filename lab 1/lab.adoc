= Lab 1 - From Zero to Pushing Your First Application

== Target

. If you haven't already, download the latest release of the Cloud Foundry CLI from https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases for your operating system and install it.

. Set the API target for the CLI: (set appropriate end point for your environment)
+
----
$ cf api https://api.run.pivotal.io --skip-ssl-validation
----

. Login to Pivotal Cloudfoundry:
+
----
$ cf login
----
+
Follow the prompts

== Push It!

. Change to the _contactDataService_ sample application directory:
+
----
$ cd $WORKSHOP_HOME/lab\ 1/contactDataService
----
. Create Service Instances for contactDataService (set appropriate service and service plan for your environment)
+
----
$ cf m
$ cf cs p-mysql 100mb p-mysql
$ cf cs cloudamqp lemur p-rabbitmq
----
. Push the application!
+
----
$ cf push
----
+
You should see output similar to the following listing. Take a look at the listing callouts for a play-by-play of what's happening:

<1> The CLI is using a manifest to provide necessary configuration details such as application name, memory to be allocated, and path to the application artifact.
Take a look at `manifest.yml` to see how.
<2> In most cases, the CLI indicates each Cloud Foundry API call as it happens.
In this case, the CLI has created an application record for _Workshop_ in your assigned space.
<3> All HTTP/HTTPS requests to applications will flow through Cloud Foundry's front-end router called http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/router.html[(Go)Router].
Here the CLI is creating a route with random word tokens inserted (again, see `manifest.yml` for a hint!) to prevent route collisions across the default `devcloudwest.inbcu.com` domain.
<4> Now the CLI is _binding_ the created route to the application.
Routes can actually be bound to multiple applications to support techniques such as http://www.mattstine.com/2013/07/10/blue-green-deployments-on-cloudfoundry[blue-green deployments].
<5> The CLI finally uploads the application bits to Pivotal Cloudfoundry. Notice that it's uploading _114 files_! This is because Cloud Foundry actually explodes a ZIP artifact before uploading it for caching purposes and uploads only files that has change from previous push.
<6> Now the CLI is _binding_ the service instances, we created in previous step, to the application. (again, see `manifest.yml` for a hint!)
<7> Now we begin the staging process. The https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack[Java Buildpack] is responsible for assembling the runtime components necessary to run the application.
<8> Here we see the version of the JRE that has been chosen and installed.
<9> Here we see the JDBC driver is pulled in automatically, since the mysql service instance is bound to application.
<10> The complete package of your application and all of its necessary runtime components is called a _droplet_.
Here the droplet is being uploaded to Pivotal Cloudfoundry's internal blobstore so that it can be easily copied to one or more _http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/architecture/execution-agent.html[Droplet Execution Agents (DEA's)]_ for execution.
<11> The CLI tells you exactly what command and argument set was used to start your application.
<12> Finally the CLI reports the current status of your application's health.

== Interact with App from CF CLI

. Get information about the currently deployed application using CLI apps command:
+
----
$ cf apps
----
+
Note the application name for next steps

. Get information about running instances, memory, CPU, and other statistics using CLI instances command
+
----
$ cf app <<app_name>>
----

. Stop the deployed application using the CLI
+
----
$ cf stop <<app_name>>
----

. Delete the deployed application using the CLI
+
----
$ cf delete <<app_name>> -r
