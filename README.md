# Pivotal Cloud Native Workshop

This is a half-day hands-on workshop to introduce key concepts in modern cloud native application development and delivery.

The session includes presentations, demos and hands-on labs. It will cover general cloud native application trends and principles, an overview of Pivotal Cloud Foundry and relevant Spring projects, and how you can get involved as we go on this cloud native journey.
